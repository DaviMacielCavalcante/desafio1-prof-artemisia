## **Description:**  
This project was developed as part of an ETL challenge for beginners. The goal is to extract, transform, and load data from a CSV file into a local database. PostgreSQL was used in this project.  

## **Features:**  
- Data extraction from a CSV file  
- Data transformation with cleaning and standardization  
- Data loading into a relational database (PostgreSQL)  
- Full CRUD functionality via API with FastAPI  

## **Installation:**  

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DaviMacielCavalcante/desafio_etl_begginer.git
   cd desafio_etl_begginer

2. Install the dependencies from requirements.txt
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Install PostgreSQL on your machine.
4. Create a .env file with the following variables
```
DATABASE_PORT = port your database is using
DATABASE_NAME = name of your database
DATABASE_USERNAME = user with access to the database
DATABASE_PASSWORD = user's password
DATABASE_URL = your database's address
```
5. Run the script responsible for creating the database schema in PostgreSQL:
